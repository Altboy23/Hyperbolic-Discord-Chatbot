‚ö†Ô∏è Important: make sure you don't share your .env file!
You can safely ignore it via .gitignore.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Bot

Run the bot using **Node.js**:

node index.js
```

Run the bot with PM:

first install pm

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

Then use PM2 

```bash

To check logs using PM2:

```

Now create a server and invite the bot to try it out!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**

Please, this is a rough tryout; be careful to reset your API keys. 
I have no responsibility on that end; I'm not an expert at this.
I just tried hard to make the idea a reality.

Also, if you run into errors you can DM me or use debugging bots like copilot


Worked on this because I know some of us like Discord way better than telegram

Goodluck!
